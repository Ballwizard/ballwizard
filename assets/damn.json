			"content": "# Russian criss-cross\n\nThe Russian criss-cross is a variant of the criss-cross drill that not only improves passing and team coordination but adds elements of shooting and finishing into the drill.\n\n### How to do the Russian criss-cross drill\n\nThe Russian criss-cross drill needs to be done with at least three pairs of three players. Two pairs are standing on one side of the baseline, one is standing on the opposite baseline. The two pairs have three balls, one for the first pair that starts the drill and two for the pair behind (the wing players have them). The pair on the other side of the court also has two balls.\n\nThe three players of the pairs are spread out on the baseline (one in the middle and two on the wings).\n\nThe first part of the drill is the same as the normal criss-cross. It starts with two regular criss-cross passes. Once the two passes have been done, the two players without the ball sprint to the players that are holding the ball which will pass them the ball. After getting the ball, the players shoot as soon as they can. The player with the ball continues dribbling to the basket to make a layup.\n\nOnce the player with the ball has made the layup, the middle player of the pair that passed the balls grabs the ball and does the same thing.\n\nThe drill can be repeated as many times as needed."

			"content": "# Layup\nA layup in basketball is a two-point shot attempt made by leaping from below, laying the ball up near the basket, and using one hand to bounce it off the backboard and into the basket or directly into the basket by throwing it in the air.\n\nThe layup is the easiest form of scoring and an open layup shouldn't be missed. It is a finishing move used in every level of competitive basketball.\n\n### How to do a layup?\nWe are going to group normal layups into two broad categories, those which are done:\n\n - From a standing position (using no dribbles)\n - From a dribble\n\nIf you have just received the ball and you haven't done any dribbles, then you have only two steps to get to the basket. The first thing you need to decide is which side of the basket are you currently on. \n\nIf the basket is on your left, then you should probably do a right-handed layup. From your starting position take a step with your right foot, holding the ball close to your body and on the right side of your body. Take another step, this time with your left foot. Then explode off of your left foot and bring your right knee up. Raise the ball above your head and throw the ball off of the backboard, aiming for the upper right corner of the white rectangle located on most backboards. \n\nIf the basket is on your right, then the logical option is to do a left-handed layup. The steps will be the same, just with a different starting foot. This time it will be with the left foot first then comes the right foot from which you jump from and shoot the ball.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are in a position where you are considerably away from the basket, dribble the ball, effectively giving you three steps for a layup. \nThe first step needs to be done just after the ball has landed on the floor. If you are on the right side, this time the first foot will be your left foot, then your right, and then finally your left foot from which you explode.\nIf you are on the left side, start with your right foot, then your left, and then your right.\n\n### When should you do a layup?\nA layup is the most used finishing move in basketball. The layup should be done when you are near the basket and the opposing defenders are not near the basket. If you are sure that you can get to the basket and that you won't get blocked by an opposing defender, the layup is probably the best choice you have. \n\n### Exercises to train in making layups\nSome exercises to help develop a feel for making layups are:\n\n- Mikan drill\n"
