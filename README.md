# Ballwizard

- **Award winning project**: 3rd place in category "Razvoj softvera" in Split-Dalmatia county (1-4 grade highschool)
- Tonƒçi and Karlo have been working on a collaborative app project, and we're excited to share our progress. Our work is organized into four distinct branches within the project repository. We worked mostly on branches named after each us, so feel free to check out our individual contributions.
- *Master Branch*: This is the core branch where we integrate the key functionalities of the app.
- *[karlo]'s Branch*: Here, you'll find the features and improvements that are mostly focused on backend with firebase, and small portion of frontend.
- *[tonci]'s Branch: Here, you'll find the features and improvements that are mostly focused on frontend.
- *Experimental*: This is place where we tested parts of our app and place where we merged it before pushing it to the master branch.
- Feel free to explore each branch to see how we've divided our tasks and brought our unique strengths to the project. Your feedback is always welcome!
