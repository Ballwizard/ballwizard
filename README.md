### What is BallWizard?
BallWizard is a mobile application designed for **learning basketball skills**. The learning process is organized into lessons that include text and image descriptions of individual skills. The lessons are categorized by the type of skills and their difficulty level, and they are suggested and adapted to the individual needs and interests of the user. The application is designed for users to go to the basketball court with their mobile device and acquire specific skills by following the lessons with detailed instructions. The instructions are in English to meet the needs of a wider audience. The application is currently available exclusively on the Android platform, but it can become compatible with iOS devices at any time because it is developed in a cross-compatible development environment, Flutter.


**Award winning project**: **Third place** won in the computer science competition in the "Software Development" category at the county level.
Tonƒçi and Karlo have been working on a collaborative app project, and we're excited to share our progress. Our work is organized into four distinct branches within the project repository. We worked mostly on branches named after each us, so feel free to check out our individual contributions.
- *Master Branch*: This is the core branch where we integrate the key functionalities of the app.
- *[karlo]'s Branch*: Here, you'll find the features and improvements that are mostly focused on backend with firebase, and small portion of frontend.
- *[tonci]'s Branch*: Here, you'll find the features and improvements that are mostly focused on frontend.
- *Experimental*: This is place where we tested parts of our app and place where we merged it before pushing it to the master branch.
Feel free to explore each branch to see how we've divided our tasks and brought our unique strengths to the project. Your feedback is always welcome!
